# My Portfolio

## Description

This project is my portfolio, showcasing my programming skills and demonstrating how I’ve grown as a programmer over time. It includes links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram accounts for potential employers interested in my work. There is a Contact page where you can send me a message and a "Resume" page that highlights my skill set. Additionally, this project serves as a menu to easily view some of my top projects and access their repositories or deployed versions.
